This is a basic library webpage which allows you to add and remove books from the page.

Local Storage is supported so it will remember your library on the same browser (IE not supported)

Live Link:

To do:

-   Redo UI
    -   fix read toggle (css flexbox?)
    -   Make table disappear when there are no books in the library but leave message that there are no books
    -   Make form overlay the whole screen
    -   format form (css grid ?)
    -   submit button should make overlay disappear
    -   new submit button ("submit and add another") should stay on form
-   Add a backend?
    -   Give choice between local and server storage
    -   Have first screen be an overlay between the two options
    -   look into firebase (or node if i have covered it)
