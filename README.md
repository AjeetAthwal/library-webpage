This is a basic library webpage which allows you to add and remove books from the page.

Local Storage is supported so it will remember your library on the same browser (IE not supported)

Improvements to make in the future:

- Redo UI
  - change font
  - responsive to max length (elipses)
  - move Library title to header and add book to header
  - Add personalised "Name" to Library Header
  - change edit icon to a toggle icon with animation
  - Cleaner form
- Add a backend server?
  - Give choice between local and server storage
  - Have first screen be an overlay between the two options
  - look into firebase (or node if i have covered it when i revisit this)
