This is a basic library webpage which allows you to add and remove books from the page.

Local Storage is supported so it will remember your library on the same browser (IE not supported)

To do:

- Redo UI
  - change edit icon to a toggle icon with animation
  - format form (css grid ?)

  - Have first screen be an overlay between the two options
  - look into firebase (or node if i have covered it)
